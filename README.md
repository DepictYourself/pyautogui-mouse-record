# pyautogui-mouse-record

### DISCLAIMER: I'm really bad at python. Don't actually use this.

## What is this ?

Create pyautogui scripts with your mouse. This app will register your mouse clicks and coordinates and output them into a file as pyautogui commands. Only works with mouse.

## How I use it

1. run pyautogui-mouse-record.py
  (it will save your mouse actions into your desktop as mouse_log.txt )
2. run log_parser.py
  (it will transform the logs into pyautogui commands and output pyautogui_commands.txt )
